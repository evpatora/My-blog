abstract: We identified 105 192 women in the vaginal bleeding (VB) cohort. Median age at VB diagnosis was 28.7 years (interquartile range = 25.2–32.5 years) and median follow-up was 17.0 years (interquartile range = 10.5–24.4 years). During the follow-up, 6581 women in the VB cohort received a cancer diagnosis. The SIR for any cancer was 1.02 (95% CI=0.99–1.04). VB was not associated with an increased risk of cancer during <6 months (SIR=0.88, 95% CI=0.65–1.18), 6–12 months (SIR=0.81, 95% CI=0.59– 1.08), or > 12 months (SIR=1.02, 95% CI=0.99–1.04) of follow-up. VB did not increase risk of cancer of the breast (SIR=1.02, 95% CI=0.98–1.07), uterine cervix (SIR=0.92, 95% CI=0.83–1.02), ovary (SIR=1.04, 95% CI=0.89–1.21), or uterus (SIR=0.94, 95% CI=0.78–1.12).
