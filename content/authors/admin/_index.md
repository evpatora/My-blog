I am a PhD student at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University. I conduct research in reproductive health focusing on abortive or near abortive events in pregnancy and their effects on the long-term health of the children and women. I am interested in pharmacoepidemiology, especially drug utilization and safety in pregnancy. I am passionate about causal inference and R stats.
